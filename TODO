idem pour blocks
item pour player

dans Board on génère les Components (flatten + sort on props.key) on récupère les refs





Be able to write ["player", {"direction": 90}]] in maps => const blockSettings = { ...settings, direction };
Manage specials blocks like "block" separately as they can move...Etc.
rename block prop name => id ?
remove addAdjacentProps from Board
empty blocks only for blocks ?
is moveOver still used ?
